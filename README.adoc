== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use Hazelcast distributed caching to cache data for your MicroProfile microservices.

This prototype includes two microservices that are running on separate Open Liberty application servers:

* A `CatalogCluster` Hazelcast distributed caching cluster is configured for the two microservices.
The product item data is stored in the caching nodes in this cluster.

* Each microservice creates a Hazelcast instance and registered with the `CatalogCluster`.
The product item data is shared for both of the services. The `catalog` microservice has read and write actions,
and the `customer` microservice only has read action.

* The `catalog` microservice has the `create`, `update` and `list` operations for creating,
updating and listing the product items in the catalog.

* The `customer` microservice has the `list` operation for listing the product items in the same catalog.

=== What is Hazelcast?

Hazelcast is an open source In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG). It provides elastically scalable distributed In-Memory computing,
widely recognized as the fastest and most scalable approach to application performance.

Hazelcast is designed to scale up to hundreds and thousands of members. Simply add new members and they will automatically
discover the cluster and will linearly increase both memory and processing capacity.


=== Why Microprofile?

The MicroProfile is a baseline platform definition that optimizes Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture and
delivers application portability across multiple MicroProfile runtimes.
To learn more about Microprofile, visit https://microprofile.io/[^].

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then run the following Maven goal to build the
application:

[role='command']
```
cd finish
mvn clean install
```

After the application is built, you can start the application with the following Maven goal:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

Once the application is started, you can visit the `catalog` endpoint in the http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui[^] URL to create,
update and view the product catalog.

First, make a POST request to the `/catalog/items/{name}/{price}` endpoint. To make this request, expand the POST
endpoint on the UI, click the `Try it out` button, provide an item name and a price,
and then click the `Execute` button.
The POST request adds a user-specified item and price to a cache storage
that represents the product item in a catalog.

Next, make a GET request to `/catalog/items` endpoint. To make this request, expand the GET
endpoint on the UI, click the `Try it out` button,
and then click the `Execute` button. The GET request
returns all of the items from your cache storage.

To update a product item, type in the same item name, and a different price in the POST request to the `/catalog/items/{name}/{price}`
endpoint, then click the click the `Execute` button. Revisit the GET request to `/catalog/items` endpoint to see the updated value.

You can also visit the `customer` endpoint in the http://localhost:9081/customer[^] URL at anytime to see the same product catalog.

== Caching data in Hazelcast

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

* Creating caching instances for the microservices in the `CatalogManager` and `CustomerController` classes

* Configure the microservices to a shared distributed caching cluster with Hazelcast

== Deploy to Kubernetes (TBD)

* Containerizing the app

* Starting and preparing a Kubernetes cluster for deployment

* Caching among Kubernetes pods

* Scaling with Hazelcast


== Testing the application

* Testing microservices that are running on Kubernetes (TBD)

* The automated endpoint tests are provided to test the microservices with the caching data:

  - The `CatalogEndpointTest` tests the `catalog` microservice's create, update and list actions.
This test also verify the `customer` microservice's list actions after each create and update product item actions.

  - The `CustomerEndpointTest` tests the `customer` microservice's list action.


== Tearing down the environment (TBD)


== Great work! You're done!
